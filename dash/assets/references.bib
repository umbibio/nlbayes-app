	abstract = {The advent of high-throughput sequencing has made it possible to measure the expression of genes at relatively low cost. However, direct measurement of regulatory mechanisms, such as Transcription Factor (TF) activity is still not readily feasible in a high-throughput manner. Consequently, there is a need for computational approaches that can reliably estimate regulator activity from observable gene expression data. In this work, we present a noisy Boolean logic Bayesian model for TF activity inference from differential gene expression data and causal graphs. Our approach provides a flexible framework to incorporate biologically motivated TF-gene regulation logic models. Using simulations and controlled over-expression experiments in cell cultures, we demonstrate that our method can accurately identify TF activity. Moreover, we apply our method to bulk and single cell transcriptomics measurements to investigate transcriptional regulation of fibroblast phenotypic plasticity. Finally, to facilitate usage, we provide user-friendly software packages and a web-interface to query TF activity from user input differential gene expression data: https://umbibio.math.umb.edu/nlbayes/.Author Summary NextGen RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has enabled simultaneous measurement of the expression level of all genes. Measurements can be done at the population level or single-cell resolution. However, direct measurement of regulatory mechanisms, such as Transcription Factor (TF) activity, is still not possible in a high-throughput manner. As such, there is a need for computational models to infer regulator activity from gene expression data. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian methodology that utilizes prior biological knowledge on bio-molecular interactions in conjunction with readily available gene expression measurements to estimate TF activity. The Bayesian model naturally incorporates biologically motivated combinatorial TF-gene interaction logic models and accounts for noise in gene expression data as well as prior knowledge. The method is accompanied by efficiently implemented R and Python software packages as well as a user-friendly web-based interface that allows users to upload their gene expression data and run queries on a TF-gene interaction network to identify and rank putative transcriptional regulators. This tool can be used for a wide range of applications, such as identification of TFs downstream of signaling events and environmental or molecular perturbations, the aberration in TF activity in diseases, and other studies with {\textquoteleft}case-control{\textquoteright} gene expression data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = "{Inference of active regulatory mechanisms underlying specific molecular and environmental perturbations is essential for understanding cellular response. The success of inference algorithms relies on the quality and coverage of the underlying network of regulator–gene interactions. Several commercial platforms provide large and manually curated regulatory networks and functionality to perform inference on these networks. Adaptation of such platforms for open-source academic applications has been hindered by the lack of availability of accurate, high-coverage networks of regulatory interactions and integration of efficient causal inference algorithms. In this work, we present CIE, an integrated platform for causal inference of active regulatory mechanisms form differential gene expression data. Using a regularized Gaussian Graphical Model, we construct a transcriptional regulatory network by integrating publicly available ChIP-seq experiments with gene-expression data from tissue-specific RNA-seq experiments. Our GGM approach identifies high confidence transcription factor (TF)–gene interactions and annotates the interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression). Benchmarks against manually curated databases of TF–gene interactions show that our method can accurately detect mode of regulation. We demonstrate the ability of our platform to identify active transcriptional regulators by using controlled in vitro overexpression and stem-cell differentiation studies and utilize our method to investigate transcriptional mechanisms of fibroblast phenotypic plasticity.}",

    abstract = "{Summary: The accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from large scale molecular profile datasets represents one of the grand challenges of Systems Biology. The Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) represents one of the most effective tools to accomplish this goal. However, the initial Fixed Bandwidth (FB) implementation is both inefficient and unable to deal with sample sets providing largely uneven coverage of the probability density space. Here, we present a completely new implementation of the algorithm, based on an Adaptive Partitioning strategy (AP) for estimating the Mutual Information. The new AP implementation (ARACNe-AP) achieves a dramatic improvement in computational performance (200× on average) over the previous methodology, while preserving the Mutual Information estimator and the Network inference accuracy of the original algorithm. Given that the previous version of ARACNe is extremely demanding, the new version of the algorithm will allow even researchers with modest computational resources to build complex regulatory networks from hundreds of gene expression profiles.Availability and Implementation: A JAVA cross-platform command line executable of ARACNe, together with all source code and a detailed usage guide are freely available on Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/aracne-ap). JAVA version 8 or higher is required.Contact:  califano@c2b2.columbia.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
